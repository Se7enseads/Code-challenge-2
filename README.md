## JSON Server

To run this challenge you will need a [Mock api]() or Mock server to 

To start using JSON Server, we need to install it, then provide a basic set of data to practice with.

First, we'll install JSON Server globally on your machine:
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```
With the command above, you should now be able to spin up a mock server from any directory on your computer. 

To actually start JSON Server, run the following command from the same directory that the [name].json file is in:
```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```
In our case the [name].json is db.json

When run, you'll see some messaging about how to access our JSON data. By default, JSON Server will start up on port 3000. You should see a notice that you can access the server at http://localhost:3000
